# Docker Compose for E2E Testing
# 
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from playwright
#
# The frontend container includes WASM (compiled from Go) - no separate API needed.
# E2E tests exercise the browser-based WASM solver, as users experience it.
